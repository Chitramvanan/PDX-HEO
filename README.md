IMPLEMENTATION:

			This project will start out as web-app with the goal to port the project to mobile 			platform after the course has ended. Although the target audience will eventually be 			mobile application users, the constraint of the development window for this class 			suggests that a web-app framework will be the best.

			We are still exploring which programming languages this application will be b			uilt with but we will be using docker-containers as our container platform.

		This project will maintain a database of the businesses/services that we will use 				 in our shelter/resource finder. Exploring sql vs postgress. 


MOTIVATION:

	Resources for house-less residents:
	
		- Cell phones can be a life-line for house-less residents and surveys suggest that many 	house-less residents have easy access to smart-phones. The goal of this project is to make it as 	simple and as user-friendly as possible for vulnerable residents to quickly find and access 	essential resources they need. 
	
	Resources for concerned citizens: 
		-As someone who spends a lot of time walking around downtown portland,  I have  	encountered many situations where a house-less resident seemed to need help 			but wasn’t having a medical emergency. I was unsure of what the best way to help was 			at the moment because of a fear of escalating the situation further for the person by 			contacting the police. There are non-profit organizations in Portland that exist to serve 			this purpose but I was not aware of that at the time. The goal of this project is to make it 		easy for residents to take the appropriate action to best help people while being ability to 		feel confident that their decision to help fits  
	on.
